# From 0 to 1 Hundred

The project is built in steps, with sub-folders dedicated to different parts of the application.

## [SVG Loader](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/RwbBywm)

Loading screen introducing the animation. The design builds on a concept I [developed first with CSS](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/yxExMw) and [then refined with SVG](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/dybJxMv).

## Base Layout

First version of the layout for the flashcard app itself. I dedicated a separate folder to the layout given the intricacies behind 3D transform properties.

## Svelte App

Application merging the previous code through the svelte framework, to present and translate numbers in the chosen range.
