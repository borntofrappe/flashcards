# flashcards

## Goal

Create an application which allows to practice with a topic through a series of flashcards.

## Stack

The project is set to rely heavily on SVG syntax and the [svelte framework](https://svelte.dev). Luckily, svelte builds on top HTML, CSS and JavaScript, allowing me to practice with a broad range of core web technologies.

## v1: From 0 to 99

In its first version, the application allows to practice with French numbers, and specifically numbers in the [0-99] range.
