# SVG Loader

`index.html` and `style.css` detail the final loader. This is however the fruit of a series of incremental steps, detailed in the different sub-folders.

- **design**: draw the SVG.

- **util**: add group elements to facilitate and enable the rocking animation.

- **animation**: animate the vector graphic.
