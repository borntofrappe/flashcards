# Svelte App

The folder is set up with the following series of commands:

1. clone the template repo.

  ```code
  npx degit sveltejs/template "Svelte App"
  ```

1. move to the folder and install the necessary package.

  ```code
  cd "Svalte App"
  npm install
  ```

1. run the development environment.

  ```code
  npm run dev
  ```

The application is developed in the **src** folder, but the **public** folder is also modified, to change the global stylesheet and document title.
