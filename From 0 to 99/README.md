## SVG Loader

Here you find the syntax used to create the loader introducing the application. It builds on a concept I [developed first with CSS](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/yxExMw) and [then refined with SVG](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/dybJxMv).

What I like most about the loader is that the details are added through semi-transparent shapes. This allows to change the color of the loader and still retain the eyes, brows, mouth and cheeks. This is not a perfect solution, as a color too close to white or black will conceal the matching details. Considering the lightness/darkness of the chosen hue though, the possibility of multiple colors is intriguing.
